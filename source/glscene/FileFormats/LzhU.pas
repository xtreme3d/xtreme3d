{
     This unit allows the user to compress data using a combination of
   LZSS compression and adaptive Huffman coding, or conversely to decompress
   data that was previously compressed by this unit.

     There are a number of options as to where the data being compressed/
   decompressed is coming from/going to.

   In fact it requires that you pass the "LZHPack" procedure 2 procedural
  parameter of type 'GetProcType' and 'PutProcType' (declared below) which
  will accept 3 parameters and act in every way like a 'BlockRead'/
  'BlockWrite' procedure call. Your 'GetBytesProc' procedure should return
  the data to be compressed, and Your 'PutBytesProc' procedure should do
  something with the compressed data (ie., put it in a file).  In case you
  need to know (and you do if you want to decompress this data again) the
  number of bytes in the compressed data (original, not compressed size)
  is returned in 'Bytes_Written'.

  GetBytesProc = PROCEDURE(VAR DTA; NBytes:WORD; VAR Bytes_Got : WORD);

  DTA is the start of a memory location where the information returned
  should be.  NBytes is the number of bytes requested.  The actual number
  of bytes returned must be passed in Bytes_Got (if there is no more data
  then 0 should be returned).

  PutBytesProc = PROCEDURE(VAR DTA; NBytes:WORD; VAR Bytes_Got : WORD);

  As above except instead of asking for data the procedure is dumping out
  compressed data, do somthing with it.


   "LZHUnPack" is basically the same thing in reverse.  It requires
  procedural parameters of type 'PutProcType'/'GetProcType' which
  will act as above.  'GetProcType' must retrieve data compressed using
  "LZHPack" (above) and feed it to the unpacking routine as requested.
  'PutProcType' must accept the decompressed data and do something
  withit.  You must also pass in the original size of the decompressed data,
  failure to do so will have adverse results.


   Don't forget that as procedural parameters the 'GetProcType'/'PutProcType'
  procedures must be compiled in the 'F+' state to avoid a catastrophe.

}

{ Note: All the large data structures for these routines are allocated when
  needed from the heap, and deallocated when finished.  So when not in use
  memory requirements are minimal.  However, this unit uses about 34K of
  heap space, and 400 bytes of stack when in use. }
