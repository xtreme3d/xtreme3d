Xtreme3D for C
==============
C binding for [Xtreme3D engine](https://github.com/xtreme3d/xtreme3d).

Usage
-----
Install CMake. Go to the `build` directory and run `cmake ..`. Then use VSCode to build generated project.

Binding Generator
-----------------
`include/xtreme3d.h` can be automatically regenerated from the Xtreme3D source code. Use `genbinding.py` for that (given the repo directory structure remains unchanged).
